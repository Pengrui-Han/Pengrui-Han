I am **Pengrui Han (Barry)**. I am currently in the **MSCS program at UIUC**, advised by [Prof. Jiaxuan You](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jiaxuan/). 

I am also a researcher in the **MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences** department, working with [Prof. Evelina Fedorenko](https://www.evlab.mit.edu/) and [Dr. Andrea de Varda](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Iwm9mC0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in the **EvLab**.

During my undergrad, I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) and [Dr. RafaÅ‚ Kocielnik](http://www.rkocielnik.com/) at **Caltech**. I also previously interned at **NVIDIA**.

Iâ€™m interested in **language and intelligence** in both humans and machines, particularly the role language plays in shaping intelligent behavior, which I study through comparisons between LLMs and humans. I analyze their behavioral capabilities and failures, examine internal mechanisms, and develop strategies to enhance intelligent machine systems.

In the past, I have also worked on fair and human-centered AI, NLP, and more. You can find more on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bSyG8UYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Personal Website](https://pengrui-han.github.io/).

I'm always open to collaborations. Please feel free to email me at phan12@illinois.edu.

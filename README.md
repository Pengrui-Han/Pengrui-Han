I am a Researcher in the [ULab](https://github.com/ulab-uiuc) at **UIUC**, advised by Prof. [Jiaxuan You](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jiaxuan/).

My current research interest is in machine learning, particularly in building intelligent agents. In the past, I have also worked on fair and human-centered AI, NLP, and more. You can find more on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bSyG8UYAAAAJ&hl=en).
